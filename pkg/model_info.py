Model information Class
Params: array of information 
Purpose: Contains information pertaining to a specific model
Process: the data that is being pass into the class,



!as of (2020-01) my thoughts about this code is that this might not be the most-correct

TODO:
 make classes for when program has this data (Inheritance ??)
    1 -> being extracted from the csv
    2 -> called from teh db, so report can be made
